# C# Console Calculator

## Project Objectives

- Ask the user for the first number
- Ask the user for the second number
- Ask the sure if they would like to add, subtract, multiply, or divide
- Return the result
- Upload the project to GitHub, but not try to host the application on GitHub pages
- **_add a .gitignore file_**

## Project Requirements
- Make a minimum of six commits.
- Include a .gitignore file that removes the .suo from source control
- Follow CSharp code conventions
- Follow the four outlined steps above. You may choose to do more, like ask for three numbers if you finish the project quickly
- Implement a form of branching, i.e. if/else or switch statement
- Validate user input and catch an exception, (resubmit or exit the program gracefully) 

>Include a .gitignore file
>>Review the previous git lesson on including a .gitignore file in your repository. You may copy and paste code from this github repository into the .gitignore file: VisualStudio.gitignore. If you do not have a .gitignore file, the .suo folder may cause you and others problems. The solution user options (.suo) file contains per-user solution options. This file should not be checked in to source code control.
